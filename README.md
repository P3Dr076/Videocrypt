# Videocrypt

VirtualDub plug-in to simulate PAL transmission standard with Videocrypt encryption used on analogue satellite transmissions. 

This type of encryption is known as line cut-and-rotate and was primarily used by Sky TV in UK (Videocrypt 1) as well Multichoice provider in Europe (Videocrypt 2). 

The only difference between the two variants is the data used in VBI area for subscriber addressing. Both variants could be used at the same time but the decoders used were incompatible with one another.
